## Find good tutorial first 
http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/tutoriallist

I like this [Steve Parker's shell scripting guide](http://steve-parker.org/sh/intro.shtml)

Steve Bourne (author of the Bourne Shell) says:

Doug Kramer (Google.com) says:
> "I highly recommend it as accurate and written at the right level, plus it includes a useful reference"
